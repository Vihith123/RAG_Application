Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.  A concentration gradient is a form of potential energy, like water  172  |  Electrolytes Important for Fluid Balance\",\n          \"Units of Measure  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI\\u2018I AT M\\u0100NOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  In  nutrition,  there  are  two  systems  of  commonly  used  measurements: Metric and US Customary.

For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties  with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to  maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\u00a0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

The DASH diet is an evidence-based eating plan that can help reduce high blood pressure. This plan may also decrease the risk of heart attack, stroke, diabetes, osteoporosis, and certain cancers.3 DASH tips to lower sodium include: • Using spices instead of salt to add flavor • Reading sodium content on processed or canned food labels, and choosing low-sodium options • Removing some sodium from canned foods (such as beans) by rinsing the product before consumption • Avoiding salt when cooking DASH dieters are recommended to consume a variety of whole grains and high-fiber fruits and vegetables, and moderate amounts of low-fat dairy products, lean meats, and heart-healthy fish. In addition, DASH limits the use of saturated fats to less than 7 percent of total calories, and limits the consumption of sweets and alcohol. The DASH diet also calls for consuming less added sugar and drinking fewer sugar-sweetened drinks. It replaces red meat with fish and legumes and calls for increased calcium, magnesium, potassium, and fiber. Also, even though some people on the DASH diet may find it lowers their HDL (good) cholesterol along with their 3. \\xa0DASH Diet Eating Plan. DASH Diet Oregon. \\xa0http://www.dashdietoregon.org/.
