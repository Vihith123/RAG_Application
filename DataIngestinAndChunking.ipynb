Bulk foods, such as fruits and vegetables, are required  to be individually labeled or to have a label next to the sale  container. The FDA does not require that individual ingredients in  multi-ingredient foods (e.g., spices) be labeled. It is important to  remember that irradiation is not a replacement for proper food  handling practices by producers, processors, and consumers.  Irradiated foods need to be stored, handled, and cooked in the  same way as non-irradiated foods, because they could still become  contaminated with disease-causing organisms after irradiation if  the rules of basic food safety are not followed.1  1.\\xa0Food Irradiation.

Type 2 diabetes is defined as a metabolic disease of insulin  insufficiency, but it is also caused by muscle, liver, and fat cells no  longer responding to the insulin in the body (Figure 18.4 “Healthy  Individuals and Type 2 Diabetes” . In brief, cells in the body have  become resistant to insulin and no longer receive the full  physiological message of insulin to take up glucose from the blood.  Thus, similar to patients with Type 1 diabetes, those with Type 2  diabetes also have high blood-glucose levels.

Vitamin C  Vitamin C, also commonly called ascorbic acid, is a water[-soluble  micronutrient essential in the diet for humans, although most other  mammals can readily synthesize it. Vitamin C’s ability to easily  donate electrons makes it a highly effective antioxidant. It is  effective in scavenging reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen  species, and many other free radicals. It protects lipids both by  disabling free radicals and by aiding in the regeneration of vitamin  E.  In addition to its role as an antioxidant, vitamin C is a required  part of several enzymes like signaling molecules in the brain, some  hormones, and ]amino acids. Vitamin C is also essential for the  synthesis and maintenance of collagen. Collagen is the most  abundant protein in the body and used for different functions such  as the structure for ligaments, tendons, and blood vessels and also  scars that bind wounds together.
